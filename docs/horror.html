          <h3 id="reprieve">Reprieve</h3>
          <h4>by James Han Mattson</h4>
          <p>
            It’s April 1997, and four hopeful contestants have made it to the
            final room of the Quigley House, a “full contact” haunted escape
            room in Lincoln, Nebraska. If they can endure the home’s six cells
            of ghoulish horror without shouting “reprieve,” they’ll win a
            substantial cash prize, but not everyone will make it out alive.
            When a man breaks into Quigley House and murders one of the
            contestants, Reprieve sifts through its characters’ back stories
            and witness statements to solve the crime. Mattson crafts a
            nail-biting horror saga while also implicating us in our sick
            obsession with horror. So too does the novel evoke blistering
            social horror, forcing us to reckon with how racism, prejudice,
            and complicity are more horrifying—and more fatal—than anything
            that goes bump in the night. Unrelenting and unforgettable,
            Reprieve is an American classic in the making.

          <h3 id="cosmology">A Cosmology of Monsters</h3>
          <h4>by Shaun Hamill</h4>
          <p>
            H.P. Lovecraft meets Stephen King in this spooky debut novel about
            a family of haunted house proprietors who are terrorized across
            generations by monsters—and not the hokey jump-scare kind. Hamill
            has crafted an ambitious, spellbinding horror novel for the ages,
            one where the looming specters of ambition, obsession, and loss
            are every bit as terrifying as the flesh-and-blood monsters
            themselves.

          <h3 id="house">The Haunting of Hill House</h3>
          <h4>by Shirley Jackson</h4>
          <p>
            If you’ve seen the Netflix series of the same name and haven’t
            read the source material, described by many as the greatest
            haunted house story ever written, it’s past time to dive into The
            Haunting of Hill House. In this seminal classic, written by the
            queen of creep, four seekers arrive at the dilapidated Hill House,
            where spooky phenomena abound, to participate in a
            parapsychological study. Jackson’s genius lies in the linkages she
            makes between haunted houses and haunted minds, which crescendo
            into an unforgettable ending. Whether you’re a first-time reader
            or a dyed-in-the-wool Jackson fan, The Haunting of Hill House
            remains a master class in horror fiction.

          <h3 id="gothic">Mexican Gothic</h3>
          <h4>by Silvia Moreno-Garcia</h4>
          <p>
            Set in Mexico circa the 1950s, Mexican Gothic opens with an
            alarming letter: newlywed Catalina writes in desperation to her
            cousin Noemí, claiming that her husband is poisoning her, and that
            “fleshless things will not let me go.” Glamorous and tough Noemí
            travels to High Place, the countryside home of Catalina’s new
            husband, Virgil Doyle, to investigate. There she encounters the
            “essentially macabre” Doyle family: English aristocrats who
            colonized the mining town where High Place is situated, and their
            frightening patriarch, a dastardly eugenicist. Plagued by
            frightening visions of ghosts and violence, Noemí plots to make
            her escape with Catalina, but High Place won’t let them go so
            easily. In this dreadful and spellbinding novel, Moreno-Garcia
            delivers Gothic horror at its finest, with a brilliant layer about
            the scourges of racism and colonialism.

          <h3 id="frankenstein">Frankenstein</h3>
          <h4>by Mary Shelley</h4>
          <p>About three things I was absolutely positive.</p>
          <p>First, Edward was a vampire.</p>
          <p>
            What can be said about Frankenstein that hasn’t been uttered a
            thousand times over? Shelley’s landmark work of Gothic horror
            revolutionized our understanding of artificial life, bewitched
            generations of readers, and pioneered science fiction as we now
            know it. Whether you’ve read Frankenstein before or you’re picking
            up the novel for the first time, there’s always something wondrous
            to discover in this strikingly original story of monstrosity,
            morality, and destruction.

          <h3 id="fledgling">Fledgling</h3>
          <h4>by Octavia E. Butler</h4>
          <p>
            In this mind-bending novel from the always-extraordinary Butler,
            we meet Shori, an injured young amnesiac who soon awakens to the
            reality of her identity: she is, in fact, a genetically modified
            vampire. Unlike her bloodsucking brethren, Shori has dark skin,
            which enables her to walk in the sunlight. As Shori investigates
            who she is and who tried to kill her, Butler transcends the
            vampire genre to ask uncomfortable questions about its mythology.
            Why must so many vampires be white? Why do we romanticize the
            violations of consent that vampires commit against their victims?
            You’ll never read a vampire novel the same way again after
            digesting Fledgling.

          <h3 id="white">White is for Witching</h3>
          <h4>by Helen Oyeyemi</h4>
          <p>
            In a haunted bed and breakfast on the cliffs of England, there
            lives a teenager named Miranda Silver, who suffers from a
            hereditary eating disorder that compels her to eat chalk. Along
            with her widowed father and her twin brother, Miranda operates the
            bed and breakfast, but this is no ordinary old house: inside these
            walls live Miranda’s maternal ancestors, a long line of malevolent
            women who exercise their xenophobia on guests in frightful and
            fatal ways. When Miranda falls in love with a Black woman, the
            house goes to violent lengths to end the romance, teeing up a
            deliciously dark fairy tale about racism, hatred, and grief.

          <h3 id="indians">The Only Good Indians</h3>
          <h4>by Stephen Graham Jones</h4>
          <p>
            In this eerie, slow-burning horror novel, four young members of
            the Blackfeet Nation break with long-held tradition by trespassing
            on hunting grounds reserved for tribal elders, where they
            slaughter a herd of elk. A decade later, their hubris comes back
            to haunt them, with a vengeful spirit hunting them down one by one
            to exact its gruesome revenge. Gory, haunting, and ultimately
            hopeful, The Only Good Indians explores what it means to navigate
            the world as an Indigenous man, where guilt, shame, and grief are
            part and parcel of life not just for those who leave the
            reservation, but for those who stay.

          <h3 id="her_body">Her Body and Other Parties</h3>
          <h4>by Carmen Maria Machado</h4>
          <p>
            In this bewitching collection of short stories set at the
            intersection of fantasy and fabulism, Machado’s enduring subject
            is the violence visited upon women’s bodies. In “The Husband
            Stitch,” Machado offers a gruesome reimagining of the familiar
            fairy tale about a wife who refuses her husband’s pleas to remove
            a green ribbon from her neck. In “Real Women Have Bodies,” a prom
            dress shop becomes the site of a horrifying discovery about women
            who’ve disappeared into the dresses’ seams. Sensual, strange, and
            disturbing, these bravura stories brew up a provocative potion of
            horror, fantasy, and science fiction.

          <h3 id="it">It</h3>
          <h4>by Stephen King</h4>
          <p>
            To choose the most horrifying among King’s dozens of spooky novels
            is an impossible task, but here at Esquire, killer clowns won the
            race. Set in King’s beloved Derry, Maine, It follows the
            hair-raising adventures of the Losers Club, a self-styled posse of
            pre-teen misfits who band together to defeat a sadistic killer
            clown disguised as their worst nightmares. Juxtaposed against this
            cosmic villainy are myriad human evils, many of which are arguably
            more insidious than Pennywise: child abuse, sexual predation, and
            racism, just to name a few. Come for the creature feature that
            shaped a generation of monstrous clowns to come, but stay for
            King’s magnum opus of memory, enduring trauma, and the indelible
            bonds between children.
