            <h4>by Jenn Lyons</h4>
            <p>
              The hugely anticipated debut by Jenn Lyons is the first fantasy
              book in the A Chorus of Dragons series. Brim-full of big ideas –
              body-swapping, prophecy, rich worldbuilding and grim commentaries
              on many aspects of empire – to name but a few, this is the tale of
              Kihrin, a young prince cursed with bad luck and worse prophecy.
              The Ruin of Kings is a fantastically complex and multi-layered
              fantasy book, and characters like Doc and Galen, alongside
              Kihrin's own well-balanced set of talents and flaws make this a
              promising new fantasy series.

              murder mystery and a delightful queer romance from debut author

              minor governmental post. However, he's actually been appointed
              parliamentary liaison to a secret magical society. If it weren’t
              for this administrative error, he’d never have discovered the
              incredible magic underlying his world. But he’ll need the help of
              Edwin Courcey, his adversarial magical-society counterpart. Thrown
              together, Robin and Edwin will discover a plot that threatens
              every magician in the British Isles.
