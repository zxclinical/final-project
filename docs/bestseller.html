            <h3 id="harry_potter1">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</h3>
            <h4>by J.K. Rowling</h4>
            <p>
              There is a door at the end of a silent corridor. And it’s haunting
              Harry Pottter’s dreams. Why else would he be waking in the middle
              of the night, screaming in terror?
            </p>
            <p>
              Harry has a lot on his mind for this, his fifth year at Hogwarts:
              a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher with a personality like
              poisoned honey; a big surprise on the Gryffindor Quidditch team;
              and the looming terror of the Ordinary Wizarding Level exams. But
              all these things pale next to the growing threat of
              He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named - a threat that neither the magical
              government nor the authorities at Hogwarts can stop.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the grasp of darkness tightens, Harry must discover the true
              depth and strength of his friends, the importance of boundless
              loyalty, and the shocking price of unbearable sacrifice.
            </p>
            <p>His fate depends on them all.</p>

            <h3 id="hunger_games">The Hunger Games</h3>
            <h4>by Suzanne Collins</h4>
            <p>
              In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the
              nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying
              districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts
              in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between
              the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual
              Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother
              and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps
              forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has
              been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature.
              Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is
              to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival
              against humanity and life against love.

            <h3 id="mockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</h3>
            <h4>by Harper Lee</h4>
            <p>
              The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town
              and the crisis of conscience that rocked it. "To Kill A
              Mockingbird" became both an instant bestseller and a critical
              success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the
              Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy
              Award-winning film, also a classic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, "To Kill A
              Mockingbird" takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to
              innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred,
              humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and
              translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young
              Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always
              considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is
              regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.

            <h3 id="pride">Pride and Prejudice</h3>
            <h4>by Jane Austen</h4>
            <p>
              Since its immediate success in 1813, Pride and Prejudice has
              remained one of the most popular novels in the English language.
              Jane Austen called this brilliant work "her own darling child" and
              its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, "as delightful a creature
              as ever appeared in print." The romantic clash between the
              opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid
              performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit
              sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of
              flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy
              of manners of Regency England.

            <h3 id="twilight">Twilight</h3>
            <h4>by Stephenie Meyer</h4>
            <p>About three things I was absolutely positive.</p>
            <p>First, Edward was a vampire.</p>
            <p>
              Second, there was a part of him—and I didn't know how dominant
              that part might be—that thirsted for my blood.
            </p>
            <p>
              And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Deeply seductive and extraordinarily suspenseful, Twilight is a
              love story with bite.

              Journeys to the end of the world, fantastic creatures, and epic
              battles between good and evil—what more could any reader ask for
              in one book? The book that has it all is The Lion, the Witch and
              the Wardrobe, written in 1949 by Clive Staples Lewis. But Lewis
              did not stop there. Six more books followed, and together they
              became known as The Chronicles of Narnia.

            <h3 id="da_vinci">The Da Vinci Code</h3>
            <h4>by Dan Brown</h4>
            <p>
              While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by
              a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the
              Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in
              baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie
              Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to
              discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da
              Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised
              by the painter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory
              of Sion—a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton,
              Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical
              secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine
              puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their
              every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.

            <h4>by Arthur Golden</h4>
            <p>
              A literary sensation and runaway bestseller, this brilliant debut
              novel presents with seamless authenticity and exquisite lyricism
              the true confessions of one of Japan's most celebrated geisha.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are
              paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest
              bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men;
              and where love is scorned as illusion. It is a unique and
              triumphant work of fiction - at once romantic, erotic, suspenseful
              - and completely unforgettable.

            <h4>by J.K. Rowling</h4>
            <p>
              Harry Potter's life is miserable. His parents are dead and he's
              stuck with his heartless relatives, who force him to live in a
              tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune changes when he
              receives a letter that tells him the truth about himself: he's a
              wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from his relatives and
              takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
              Wizardry.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally
              feels like a normal kid. But even within the Wizarding community,
              he is special. He is the boy who lived: the only person to have
              ever survived a killing curse inflicted by the evil Lord
              Voldemort, who launched a brutal takeover of the Wizarding world,
              only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not
              everything is perfect. There is a dangerous secret object hidden
              within the castle walls, and Harry believes it's his
              responsibility to prevent it from falling into evil hands. But
              doing so will bring him into contact with forces more terrifying
              than he ever could have imagined.

            <h3 id="divergent">Divergent</h3>
            <h4>by Veronica Roth</h4>
            <p>
              In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided
              into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a
              particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless),
              Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the
              intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all
              sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will
              devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is
              between staying with her family and being who she really is—she
              can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone,
              including herself.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice
              renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates
              to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo
              extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological
              simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation
              transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really
              are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating,
              sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But
              Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone
              because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers
              unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly
              perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her
              save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.

              The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald's third book, stands as the

              is of the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his new love for the
              beautiful Daisy Buchanan, of lavish parties on Long Island at a
              time when The New York Times noted "gin was the national drink and
              sex the national obsession," it is an exquisitely crafted tale of

            <h4>by Paulo Coelho</h4>
            <p>
              Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following
              around the world. This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity
              and soul-stirring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy
              named Santiago, who travels from his homeland in Spain to the
              Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried near the Pyramids.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along the way he meets a Romany woman, a man who calls himself a
              king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the right
              direction for his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or
              whether Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles in his
              path; but what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns
              into a discovery of treasure within.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an
              eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the
              importance of listening to our hearts.

            <h3 id="crime">Crime and Punishment</h3>
            <h4>by Fyodor Dostoevsky</h4>
            <p>
              Raskolnikov, a destitute and desperate former student, wanders
              through the slums of St Petersburg and commits a random murder
              without remorse or regret. He imagines himself to be a great man,
              a Napoleon: acting for a higher purpose beyond conventional moral
              law. But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a
              suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the
              growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of his own
              guilt tightening around his neck. Only Sonya, a downtrodden sex
              worker, can offer the chance of redemption.

            <h3 id="romeo">Romeo and Juliet</h3>
            <h4>by William Shakespeare</h4>
            <p>
              In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare creates a violent world, in which
              two young people fall in love. It is not simply that their
              families disapprove; the Montagues and the Capulets are engaged in
              a blood feud.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this death-filled setting, the movement from love at first
              sight to the lovers’ final union in death seems almost inevitable.
              And yet, this play set in an extraordinary world has become the
              quintessential story of young love. In part because of its
              exquisite language, it is easy to respond as if it were about all
              young lovers.

            <h3 id="ring">The Lord of the Rings</h3>
            <h4>by J.R.R. Tolkien</h4>
            <p>
              In The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins is whisked away from his comfortable,
              unambitious life in Hobbiton by the wizard Gandalf and a company
              of dwarves. He finds himself caught up in a plot to raid the
              treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very
              dangerous dragon.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo
              Baggins and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the wizard; the
              hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the dwarf; Legolas the elf;
              Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider.
              J.R.R. Tolkien's three volume masterpiece is at once a classic
              myth and a modern fairy tale—a story of high and heroic adventure
              set in the unforgettable landscape of Middle-earth
