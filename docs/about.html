          A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or
          images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment,
          vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover. The
          technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural,
          codices). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended
          written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor,
          the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a
          leaf is a page.

        <h3>Genres</h3>
        <p>
          Writing genres (more commonly known as literary genres) are categories
          that distinguish literature (including works of prose, poetry, drama,
          hybrid forms, etc.) based on some set of stylistic criteria. Sharing
          literary conventions, they typically consist of similarities in
          theme/topic, style, tropes, and storytelling devices; common settings
          and character types; and/or formulaic patterns of character
          interactions and events, and an overall predictable form.

        <h3>Action and Adventure</h3>
        <p>
          Action and adventure books constantly have you on the edge of your
          seat with excitement, as your fave main character repeatedly finds
          themselves in high stakes situations. The protagonist has an ultimate
          goal to achieve and is always put in risky, often dangerous
          situations. This genre typically crosses over with others like
          mystery, crime, sci-fi, and fantasy.

          You may think of these books as the throwback readings you were
          assigned in English class. The classics have been around for decades,
          and were often groundbreaking stories at their publish time, but have
          continued to be impactful for generations, serving as the foundation
          for many popular works we read today.

        <h3>Comic Book or Graphic Novel</h3>
        <p>
          The stories in comic books and graphic novels are presented to the
          reader through engaging, sequential narrative art (illustrations and
          typography) that's either presented in a specific design or the
          traditional panel layout you find in comics. With both, you'll often
          find the dialogue presented in the tell-tale "word balloons" next to
          the respective characters.

          in morbid stories that are sometimes a little too realistic. The
          master of horror fiction? None other than Stephen King.

          Though it can be seen as a broad genre that encompasses many others,
          literary fiction refers to the perceived artistic writing style of the
          author. Their prose is meant to evoke deep thought through stories
          that offer personal or social commentary on a particular theme.

          Though they're often thought of in the same vein as fantasy, what
          distinguishes science fiction stories is that they lean heavily on
          themes of technology and future science. You'll find apocalyptic and

          Though they encompass many of the genres we describe here, short
          stories are brief prose that are significantly, well, shorter than
          novels. Writers strictly tell their narratives through a specific
          theme and a series of brief scenes, though many authors compile these
          stories in wide-ranging collections, as featured below.

        <h3>Suspense and Thrillers</h3>
        <p>
          While they often encompass the same elements as mystery books, the
          suspense and thriller genre sees the hero attempt to stop and defeat
          the villain to save their own life rather than uncover a specific
          crime. Thrillers typically include cliffhangers and deception to
          encourage suspense, while pulling the wool over the eyes of both the
          main character and reader.
