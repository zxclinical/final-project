          <h3 id="judge">The Judge's List</h3>
          <h4>by John Grisham</h4>
          <p>
            In The Whistler, Lacy Stoltz investigated a corrupt judge who was
            taking millions in bribes from a crime syndicate. She put the
            criminals away, but only after being attacked and nearly killed.
            Three years later, and approaching forty, she is tired of her work
            for the Florida Board on Judicial Conduct and ready for a change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then she meets a mysterious woman who is so frightened she uses a
            number of aliases. Jeri Crosby’s father was murdered twenty years
            earlier in a case that remains unsolved and that has grown stone
            cold. But Jeri has a suspect whom she has become obsessed with and
            has stalked for two decades. Along the way, she has discovered
            other victims.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suspicions are easy enough, but proof seems impossible. The man is
            brilliant, patient, and always one step ahead of law enforcement.
            He is the most cunning of all serial killers. He knows forensics,
            police procedure, and most important: he knows the law.
          </p>
          <p>He is a judge, in Florida—under Lacy’s jurisdiction.</p>

          <h3 id="bees">Go Tell The Bees That I Am Gone</h3>
          <h4>by Diana Gabaldon</h4>
          <p>
            Jamie Fraser and Claire Randall were torn apart by the Jacobite
            Rising in 1746, and it took them twenty years to find each other
            again. Now the American Revolution threatens to do the same. It is
            1779 and Claire and Jamie are at last reunited with their
            daughter, Brianna, her husband, Roger, and their children on
            Fraser’s Ridge. Having the family together is a dream the Frasers
            had thought impossible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet even in the North Carolina backcountry, the effects of war are
            being felt. Tensions in the Colonies are great and local feelings
            run hot enough to boil Hell’s teakettle. Jamie knows loyalties
            among his tenants are split and it won’t be long until the war is
            on his doorstep. Brianna and Roger have their own worry: that the
            dangers that provoked their escape from the twentieth century
            might catch up to them. Sometimes they question whether risking
            the perils of the 1700s—among them disease, starvation, and an
            impending war—was indeed the safer choice for their family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not so far away, young William Ransom is still coming to terms
            with the discovery of his true father’s identity—and thus his
            own—and Lord John Grey has reconciliations to make, and dangers to
            meet . . . on his son’s behalf, and his own. Meanwhile, the
            Revolutionary War creeps ever closer to Fraser’s Ridge. And with
            the family finally together, Jamie and Claire have more at stake
            than ever before.

          <h3 id="wish">Wish You Were Here</h3>
          <h4>by Jodi Picoult</h4>
          <p>
            Diana O’Toole is perfectly on track. She will be married by
            thirty, done having kids by thirty-five, and move out to the New
            York City suburbs, all while climbing the professional ladder in
            the cutthroat art auction world. She’s an associate specialist at
            Sotheby’s now, but her boss has hinted at a promotion if she can
            close a deal with a high-profile client. She’s not engaged just
            yet, but she knows her boyfriend, Finn, a surgical resident, is
            about to propose on their romantic getaway to the Galápagos—days
            before her thirtieth birthday. Right on time.
          </p>
          <p>
            But then a virus that felt worlds away has appeared in the city,
            and on the eve of their departure, Finn breaks the news: It’s all
            hands on deck at the hospital. He has to stay behind. You should
            still go, he assures her, since it would be a shame for all of
            their nonrefundable trip to go to waste. And so, reluctantly, she
            goes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost immediately, Diana’s dream vacation goes awry. Her luggage
            is lost, the Wi-Fi is nearly nonexistent, and the hotel they’d
            booked is shut down due to the pandemic. In fact, the whole island
            is now under quarantine, and she is stranded until the borders
            reopen. Completely isolated, she must venture beyond her comfort
            zone. Slowly, she carves out a connection with a local family when
            a teenager with a secret opens up to Diana, despite her father’s
            suspicion of outsiders.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Galápagos Islands, where Darwin’s theory of evolution by
            natural selection was formed, Diana finds herself examining her
            relationships, her choices, and herself—and wondering if when she
            goes home, she too will have evolved into someone completely
            different.

          <h3 id="storyteller">The Storyteller</h3>
          <h4>by Dave Grohl</h4>
          <p>
            Having entertained the idea for years, and even offered a few
            questionable opportunities ("It's a piece of cake! Just do 4 hours
            of interviews, find someone else to write it, put your face on the
            cover, and voila!") I have decided to write these stories just as
            I have always done, in my own hand. The joy that I have felt from
            chronicling these tales is not unlike listening back to a song
            that I've recorded and can't wait to share with the world, or
            reading a primitive journal entry from a stained notebook, or even
            hearing my voice bounce between the Kiss posters on my wall as a
            child.
          </p>
          <p>
            This certainly doesn't mean that I'm quitting my day job, but it
            does give me a place to shed a little light on what it's like to
            be a kid from Springfield, Virginia, walking through life while
            living out the crazy dreams I had as young musician. From hitting
            the road with Scream at 18 years old, to my time in Nirvana and
            the Foo Fighters, jamming with Iggy Pop or playing at the Academy
            Awards or dancing with AC/DC and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band,
            drumming for Tom Petty or meeting Sir Paul McCartney at Royal
            Albert Hall, bedtime stories with Joan Jett or a chance meeting
            with Little Richard, to flying halfway around the world for one
            epic night with my daughters…the list goes on. I look forward to
            focusing the lens through which I see these memories a little
            sharper for you with much excitement.

          <h3 id="will">Will</h3>
          <h4>by Will Smith</h4>
          <p>About three things I was absolutely positive.</p>
          <p>First, Edward was a vampire.</p>
          <p>
            Will Smith’s transformation from a West Philadelphia kid to one of
            the biggest rap stars of his era, and then one of the biggest
            movie stars in Hollywood history, is an epic tale—but it’s only
            half the story.
          </p>
          <p>
            Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not
            only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the
            pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that
            way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a
            seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out
            Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over.
          </p>
          <p>
            This memoir is the product of a profound journey of
            self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you
            and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark
            Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art
            of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one person mastered
            his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do
            the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the
            world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all
            understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey
            might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home.
            The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life
            story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts
            Will the book, like its author, in a category by itself.

          <h4>by Amor Towles</h4>
          <p>
            In June, 1954, eighteen-year-old Emmett Watson is driven home to
            Nebraska by the warden of the juvenile work farm where he has just
            served fifteen months for involuntary manslaughter. His mother
            long gone, his father recently deceased, and the family farm
            foreclosed upon by the bank, Emmett's intention is to pick up his
            eight-year-old brother, Billy, and head to California where they
            can start their lives anew. But when the warden drives away,
            Emmett discovers that two friends from the work farm have hidden
            themselves in the trunk of the warden's car. Together, they have
            hatched an altogether different plan for Emmett's future, one that
            will take them all on a fateful journey in the opposite
            direction—to the City of New York.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spanning just ten days and told from multiple points of view,
            Towles's third novel will satisfy fans of his multi-layered
            literary styling while providing them an array of new and richly
            imagined settings, characters, and themes.

          <h3 id="stanger">The Stanger In The Lifeboat</h3>
          <h4>by Mitch Albom</h4>
          <p>
            While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by
            a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the
            Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in
            baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie
            Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to
            discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da
            Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised
            by the painter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory
            of Sion—a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton,
            Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical
            secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine
            puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their
            every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.

          <h4>by Amanda Gorman</h4>
          <p>
            Formerly titled The Hill We Climb and Other Poems, the luminous
            poetry collection by #1 New York Times bestselling author and
            presidential inaugural poet Amanda Gorman captures a shipwrecked
            moment in time and transforms it into a lyric of hope and healing.
            In Call Us What We Carry, Gorman explores history, language,
            identity, and erasure through an imaginative and intimate collage.
            Harnessing the collective grief of a global pandemic, this
            beautifully designed volume features poems in many inventive
            styles and structures and shines a light on a moment of reckoning.
            Call Us What We Carry reveals that Gorman has become our messenger
            from the past, our voice for the future.

          <h3 id="1916">The 1916 Project</h3>
          <h4>by Nikole Hannah-Jones</h4>
          <p>
            In late August 1619, a ship arrived in the British colony of
            Virginia bearing a cargo of twenty to thirty enslaved people from
            Africa. Their arrival led to the barbaric and unprecedented system
            of American chattel slavery that would last for the next 250
            years. This is sometimes referred to as the country’s original
            sin, but it is more than that: It is the source of so much that
            still defines the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            The New York Times Magazine’s award-winning “1619 Project” issue
            reframed our understanding of American history by placing slavery
            and its continuing legacy at the center of our national narrative.
            This new book substantially expands on that work, weaving together
            eighteen essays that explore the legacy of slavery in present-day
            America with thirty-six poems and works of fiction that illuminate
            key moments of oppression, struggle, and resistance. The essays
            show how the inheritance of 1619 reaches into every part of
            contemporary American society, from politics, music, diet,
            traffic, and citizenship to capitalism, religion, and our
            democracy itself.

          <h4>by Colleen Hoover</h4>
          <p>
            Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from
            working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from
            the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved
            to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a
            spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything
            in Lily’s life seems too good to be true.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s
            also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And
            the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get
            him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships
            is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception
            to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him
            that way in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do
            thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past
            she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When
            Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is
            threatened.

            Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally
            ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life.
            But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for
            the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her?
            Why now?
          </p>
          <p>
            Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left
            her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why
            Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is
            determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.
          </p>
          <p>
            Summoned to Evelyn’s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in
            fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to
            Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in
            the ‘80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn
            unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a
            great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real
            connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn’s story near its
            conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with
            Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.

          <h3 id="verity">Verity</h3>
          <h4>by Colleen Hoover</h4>
          <p>
            Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial
            ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy
            Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired
            Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his
            injured wife is unable to finish.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of
            Verity’s notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get
            her started. What Lowen doesn’t expect to uncover in the chaotic
            office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for
            anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions,
            including Verity's recollection of the night her family was
            forever altered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing
            its contents could devastate the already grieving father. But as
            Lowen’s feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all
            the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife’s words.
            After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a
            truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue
            loving her.

          <h3 id="achilles">The Song Of Achilles</h3>
          <h4>by Madeline Miller</h4>
          <p>
            A tale of gods, kings, immortal fame, and the human heart, The
            Song of Achilles is a dazzling literary feat that brilliantly
            reimagines Homer’s enduring masterwork, The Iliad. An
            action-packed adventure, an epic love story, a marvelously
            conceived and executed page-turner, Miller’s monumental debut
            novel has already earned resounding acclaim from some of
            contemporary fiction’s brightest lights—and fans of Mary Renault,
            Bernard Cornwell, Steven Pressfield, and Colleen McCullough’s
            Masters of Rome series will delight in this unforgettable journey
            back to ancient Greece in the Age of Heroes.
